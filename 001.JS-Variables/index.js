// variable declare in 4 wayes now write some code

//EXAMPLE

x = 25;
y = 23;
z = x + y;
console.log(z);

// example use in var

var a = 56;
var b = 53;
var c = a + b;
console.log(c);

// example to use let

let s = 22;
let r = 53;
let d = s + r;
console.log(d);

//now use to the const
const p = 22;
const q = 3;
const rana = p + q;
console.log(rana);

//and also use to the mixed variable

const person1 = "rana";
const person2 = " shoron";
